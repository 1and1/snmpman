{"name":"SNMPMAN","tagline":"","body":"SNMPMAN\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe `SNMPMAN` is mainly a command-line application that simulates `SNMP`-capable devices and can also be started and stopped within Unit-Tests.\r\nIt may used e.g. to test traffic monitoring applications that execute `SNMP` queries. Due to to the lack in\r\nflexibility of already existing alternatives, it was developed by the **1&1 Internet AG** to avoid those deficits. Therefore the `SNMPMAN`\r\nis highly extensible and will feature and will be enhanced in time.\r\n\r\nMultiple `SNMP` agents may be started at once and will run in parallel on different parts. These agents\r\nwill return the data defined in a textual walk file. This file may be created by querying a real device. In addition,\r\nseveral device types may be defined and mapped by the agents. This device type configuration may contain policies on\r\nhow to dynamically change the query responses. E.g. the response of an\r\n[ifInOctets](http://tools.cisco.com/Support/SNMP/do/BrowseOID.do?objectInput=ifInOctets&translate=Translate&submitValue=SUBMIT\")\r\nmay be incremented with each query to simulate traffic. Several variable modifiers are already existing for different\r\ndata types.\r\n\r\nAlso checkout the `SNMPMAN` GitHub IO page [here](http://1and1.github.io/snmpman/)!\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n### Prequisites\r\n  * `Java JDK 1.8`\r\n  * `Gradle 2.2`\r\n\r\n### Packaging\r\nIn order to package the `SNMPMAN` - as either a `.deb` or `.rpm` - you have to execute following gradle tasks\r\n\r\n  * `buildDeb`\r\n  * `buildRpm`\r\n\r\nYou will find the generated output in `./build/distributions` and can install the build packages.\r\n\r\nExecution\r\n============\r\nTo execute an instance of the `SNMPMAN` you have to start the execution script and specify a value for the `-c`\r\nor `--configuration` option that lists the path to the configuration `YAML` file that should be loaded in the execution context.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n============\r\nThe `SNMPMAN` is configured in two main `YAML` files ...\r\n  * The agent configuration list all agents which should be started\r\n  * The device type configuration defines the modifiers that should be applied to a range of OIDs\r\n\r\nYou can find some `YAML` example configuration files within the test resources of this project in the directory\r\n```\r\n../src/test/resources/configuration\r\n```\r\nThe third component of the configuration are the walk files for the agents as specified in the agent configuration.\r\n\r\nThis is a basic overview and more information will be provided [on the projects Wiki pages](https://github.com/1and1/snmpman/wiki).\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\nTo contribute, use the GitHub way - fork, hack, and submit a pull request!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

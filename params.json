{"name":"SNMPMAN","tagline":"","body":"SNMPMAN\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe `SNMPMAN` is a command-line application that simulates `SNMP`-capable devices.\r\nIt may used e.g. to test traffic monitoring applications that execute `SNMP` queries. Due to to the lack in\r\nflexibility of already existing alternatives, it was developed by the **1&1 Internet AG** to avoid those deficits. Therefore the `SNMPMAN`\r\nis highly extensible and will feature and will be enhanced in time.\r\n\r\nMultiple `SNMP` agents may be started at once and will run in parallel on different parts. These agents\r\nwill return the data defined in a textual walk file. This file may be created by querying a real device. In addition,\r\nseveral device types may be defined and mapped by the agents. This device type configuration may contain policies on\r\nhow to dynamically change the query responses. E.g. the response of an\r\n[ifInOctets](http://tools.cisco.com/Support/SNMP/do/BrowseOID.do?objectInput=ifInOctets&translate=Translate&submitValue=SUBMIT\")\r\nmay be incremented with each query to simulate traffic. Several variable modifiers are already existing for different\r\ndata types.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n### Prequisites\r\n  * `Java JRE 1.7`\r\n\r\n### Packaging\r\nThe `SNMPMAN` can be packaged for Debian installations by executing the Maven profile `debian`. All resources will be installed in the root directory `/opt/snmpman`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to create a RPM package you should execute the `build-rpm.sh`. The RPM file will be copied into your current working directory after it was created.\r\n\r\nSome basic configuration files will be copied to `/opt/snmpman/etc`. One default device will be simulated at `127.0.0.1:10000` by the default configuration.\r\n\r\nExecution\r\n============\r\nTo execute an instance of the `SNMPMAN` you have to start the execution script and specify a value for the `-c`\r\nor `--configuration` option that lists the path to the configuration file that should be loaded in the execution context.\r\n\r\nIf no arguments were specified, the default configuration in `/opt/snmpman/etc/configuration.xml` will be used.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n============\r\nThe `SNMPMAN` is configured in two main `XML` files ...\r\n  * The agent configuration _(Namespace: http://www.1and1.com/snmpman/configuration)_\r\n  * The device type configuration _(Namespace: http://www.1and1.com/snmpman/device)_\r\n\r\nThe `XML` schema files can be found in this project in the directory\r\n```\r\n../src/main/resources/schema\r\n```\r\nThe third component of the configuration are the walk files for the agents as specified in the agent configuration.\r\n\r\nThis is a basic overview and more information will be provided [on the projects Wiki pages](https://github.com/1and1/snmpman/wiki).\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\nTo contribute, use the GitHub way - fork, hack, and submit a pull request!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

The `SNMPMAN` is a command-line application that simulates `SNMP`-capable devices and was developed to be usable during unit testing.
It may be used to test traffic monitoring applications that execute `SNMP` queries. Due to the lack of
flexibility in already existing alternatives, it was developed by the **1&1 Internet AG** to improve flexibility. Therefore the `SNMPMAN`
is highly extendable and will be enhanced over time.

Multiple `SNMP` agents may be started at once and will run in parallel. The agents running in parallel
will return the data queried and save it to a textual walk result file. This file will be created by querying a real device. It is also possible to query several 
device types at once. The query configuration may contain policies on
how to dynamically change the query responses. E.g. the response of an
[ifInOctets](http://tools.cisco.com/Support/SNMP/do/BrowseOID.do?objectInput=ifInOctets&translate=Translate&submitValue=SUBMIT")
may be incremented with each query to simulate traffic. Several variable modifiers are already in existence for different
data types.

Also checkout the `SNMPMAN` GitHub IO page [here](http://1and1.github.io/snmpman/)!

Usage
============
You can include the `SNMPMAN` as a Maven dependency from [Maven Central]().

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.oneandone</groupId>
    <artifactId>snmpman</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.8</version>
</dependency>
```

In order to start and stop the simulation use this code snippet as an example:

```Java
/* 
 * creates a new instance of the SNMPMAN with the specified configuration file 
 * and executes all agents 
 */
Snmpman snmpman = Snmpman.start(new File("configuration.yaml"));
/* ... do something with the agents */

/* stop the SNMPMAN and all started agents */
snmpman.stop();
```

Installation and building
============
### Prerequisites
  * `Java JDK 1.8`
  * `Apache Maven 3.5.2`

### Building a fat Jar

In order to build the `SNMPMAN`  you can use Apache Maven to build a far JAR:

```
mvn clean package
```

After that you find your JAR in `snmpman-cli/target/snmpman-cli-$VERSION-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

Execution
============
To execute an instance of the `SNMPMAN` you have to start the execution script and specify a value for the `-c`
or `--configuration` option that lists the path to the configuration `YAML` file that will be loaded during execution.

Configuration
============
The `SNMPMAN` configuration can be found in two main `YAML` files ...
  * The agent configuration lists all agents which will be started
  * The device type configuration defines the modifiers that will be applied to a range of OIDs

You can find some `YAML` example configuration files within the test resources of this project in [this](https://github.com/1and1/snmpman/tree/master/snmpman-cli/src/test/resources/configuration
) directory.

The third component of the configuration are the walk files for the agents as specified in the agent configuration.

This is a basic overview and more information will be provided [on the project's Wiki pages](https://github.com/1and1/snmpman/wiki).
